# HAProxy_on_AWS_configuration_Ansible

I've created an Ansible playbook to Configure Reverse Proxy i.e. Haproxy and update it's configuration file automatically on each time new Managed node (Configured With Apache Webserver) join the inventory. Ansible is a great tool for Configuration Management & Automation. This Task was given by Sir Vimal Daga in the Arth training recently.

## ARTH Task 12.2
ðŸ”° Write an Ansible PlayBook that does the following operations in the managed nodes:\
ðŸ”¹ Configurs HAProxy one Managed Node\
ðŸ”¹ Configures Apache Webserver (HTTPD) on other Managed Nodes\
ðŸ”¹ It should automatically update the Haproxy Configuration file (configured on one of the Managed Node) each time a new Managed Node joins th inventory for webservice configuration.
- the above setup needs to Configured on AWS instances. ðŸš©

Hope you guys liked it! Thanks for reading, I'll meet you in the next one. ðŸ˜Š
